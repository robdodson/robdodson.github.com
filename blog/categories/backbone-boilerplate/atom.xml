    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing from <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/28/mocking-requests-with-mocha-chai-and-sinon/">yesterday's post</a> I'm going to start to incorporate Backbone into my BDD setup. I'm going to use the <a href="https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate">Backbone Boilerplate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb">grunt-bbb</a> to setup a new project. If you're new to the boilerplate or grunt-bbb <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/17/getting-familiar-with-backbone-boilerplate/">checkout my previous post on getting started.</a></p>

<h3>Shiny and new</h3>

<p>I've created a new directory called <code>amd-tests</code> and once I <code>cd</code> inside I run <code>bbb init</code> to template out a new project. By default the boilerplate uses Require.js and AMD modules and we have a little example one already created for us. It's called, well, Example :) We'll use this to create our model for testing since I know that everyone should be on the same page with this module.</p>

<p>I'm going to change our model's name from Example.Model to Example.Photo so our terminalogy won't get muddy. We'll give it some default properties for <code>src</code> and <code>caption</code>. Later on we'll test that a freshly created model has these same defaults. When we're done setting up our <code>/app/example.js</code> file should look like this. Keep in mind that the boilerplate adds a lot of stuff to get us started so you can ignore everything that isn't Example.Photo</p>

<p>``` js /app/example.js
define([
  "namespace",</p>

<p>  // Libs
  "use!backbone"</p>

<p>  // Modules</p>

<p>  // Plugins
],</p>

<p>function(namespace, Backbone) {</p>

<p>  // Create a new module
  var Example = namespace.module();</p>

<p>  // !!! Our awesome new model !!!
  Example.Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({</p>

<pre><code>defaults: {
  src: '/images/placeholder.jpg',
  caption: 'Waiting for content...'
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  Example.Collection = Backbone.Collection.extend({ /<em> ... </em>/ });
  Example.Router = Backbone.Router.extend({ /<em> ... </em>/ });</p>

<p>  // This will fetch the tutorial template and render it.
  Example.Views.Tutorial = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>template: "app/templates/example.html",

render: function(done) {
  var view = this;

  // Fetch the template, render it to the View element and call done.
  namespace.fetchTemplate(this.template, function(tmpl) {
    view.el.innerHTML = tmpl();

    // If a done function is passed, call it with the element
    if (_.isFunction(done)) {
      done(view.el);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  // Required, return the module for AMD compliance
  return Example;</p>

<p>});
```
Now comes the rather tricky part. We need to create a test runner HTML file that can incorporate mocha, chai and sinon. It also has to load our Example module and maintain all of that module's dependencies. I spent a <em>ton</em> of time on IRC today sorting this out so here is my current best stab at things based on some <a href="https://gist.github.com/2655876">VERY generous gists</a> from <a href="https://github.com/kmiyashiro">Kelly Miyashiro.</a></p>

<p>Let's start with the index.html file that'll be our test runner:</p>

<p>``` html test/index.html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Mocha Tests</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="mocha/mocha.css" />
  <script src="../assets/js/libs/require.js"></script>
  <script src="mocha/mocha.js"></script>
  <script src="sinon/sinon.js"></script>
  <script src="config.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script></p>

<pre><code>require([
  '../test/test.example'
], runMocha);
</code></pre>

<p>  </script>
  <div id="mocha"></div>
</body>
</html>
```</p>

<p>The first thing we do is add require.js, then mocha and sinon. Why no Chai? Good question. Kelly didn't do it so I didn't do it. If anyone wants to cite the pros and cons of this approach I'm all ears. Next we add our own config.js that is specific to our tests. We might have a config.js somewhere else that runs our main app but we'll also need this one to run our tests. Finally we have a script block sitting on top of our <code>#mocha</code> div. The script block loads in our specs (in this case I've only written one but you can do multiple specs here). A final argument to the require call is <code>runMocha</code>. Essentially this is the function that is executed <em>AFTER</em> the modules have finished loading. In our case runMocha is located inside the new config.js we've defined just for our tests. Let's take a look at it now.</p>

<p>``` js test/config.js
require.config({</p>

<pre><code>// Base URL relative to the test runner
// Paths are relative to this
baseUrl: '../app',
paths: {
    // Testing libs
    'chai'          : '../test/chai/chai',
    'common'        : '../test/common',
    'jquery'        : '../assets/js/libs/jquery',
    'underscore'    : '../assets/js/libs/underscore',
    'backbone'      : '../assets/js/libs/backbone',
    'use'           : '../assets/js/plugins/use'
},
use: {
    backbone: {
        deps: ['use!underscore', 'jquery'],
        attach: 'Backbone'
    },
    underscore: {
        attach: '_'
    },
    mocha: {
        attach: 'mocha'
    }
},
priority: [
    'jquery',
    'underscore',
    'common'
]
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>mocha.setup({</p>

<pre><code>ui: 'bdd',
ignoreLeaks: true
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>// Protect from barfs
console = window.console || function() {};</p>

<p>var runMocha = function() {</p>

<pre><code>mocha.run();
</code></pre>

<p>};
```</p>

<p>Lots of stuff here but nothing to get alarmed about. <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/17/getting-familiar-with-backbone-boilerplate/">If you've read my previous getting started post you'll know all about the config.js file.</a> Go back and read the previous post if none of this makes sense to you. The thing to take note of is the <code>priority</code> array and the <code>runMocha</code> function at the bottom of the page. I don't have much experience with the priority array and I didn't find much documentation on it but Kelly uses it <a href="https://gist.github.com/2655876">in the gists</a> to make sure that jQuery, chai and any chai plugins are properly setup on the page.</p>

<p>``` js test/common.js
// Include and setup all the stuff for testing
define(function(require) {</p>

<pre><code>window.$ = window.jQuery = require('jquery');
window.chai         = require('chai');
window.expect       = chai.expect;
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Good practice? Bad practice? I'm not sure and I would love comments if anyone has a take on things. Underneath the priority array is a setup function which sends some configuration parameters to mocha. <code>ignoreLeaks</code> is useful because it's easy for mocha to see jQuery or any other global variable as a good reason to abort a test. IMO that's what JSLint/Hint is for, and bailing everytime you see a global is going to make testing 3rd party code especially difficult. My advice, leave it off. Finally we call <code>mocha.run()</code> via the <code>runMocha</code> function. Remember that this function is executed inside our test runner after all the specs are loaded, like so:</p>

<p>``` html test/index.html</p>

<script>
    require([
      '../test/test.example'
    ], runMocha);
  </script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Doing it this way guarantees that all the dependencies our module needs will be loaded before we start running our tests.</p>

<h3>Oh right, the tests!</h3>

<p>Wow! OK so hopefully you're still with me because after all of that we <em>still</em> need to generate some tests. Since it's getting late I'm just going to put together a really simple spec to make sure our default values are being set on the model.</p>

<p>I've created a file called <code>test.example.js</code> which will test our <code>Example</code> module.</p>

<p>``` js test/test.example.js
define(function(require) {
  var Example = require('modules/example');</p>

<p>  describe('Example', function() {</p>

<pre><code>describe('Photo', function() {
  var photo = new Example.Photo();
  it('should have proper defaults', function(done) {
      expect(photo.get('src')).to.equal('/images/placeholder.jpg');
      expect(photo.get('caption')).to.equal('Waiting for content...');
      done();
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>  });
});
```</p>

<p>It isn't amazing but it gets us started testing our module. I'm explicitly calling <code>done()</code> at the end of our test because I saw mention on StackOverflow that you should do this when testing AMD modules in the browser with mocha otherwise you can get false passing tests. Not sure if it's absolutely necessary but I guess better safe than sorry!</p>

<p>At this point I'm exhausted and hopefully you have a decent head start on your tests. I know that this post jumps around a lot so please take a moment <a href="https://github.com/robdodson/backbone-boilerplate-mocha">to grab the repo I've posted which contains all the source code.</a> Again. Caveat. I'm learning along with you so there are lots of newbie mistakes being made, I'm sure. I really want to hear your feedback if you have any. Good luck!</p>

    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/18/backbone-boilerplate-playing-with-require-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to keep playing with require.js and AMD modules today so I can really internalize the concepts around them. I'm going to go through the examples in <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#jsfiles">the require documentation</a> starting with loading regular scripts and then defining modules and loading those.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here is our boilerplate HTML. It's a standard HTML5 file which just includes require.js at the bottom of the page.
``` html
&lt;!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"></p>

<p>  <title>Require.js Sandbox</title></p>

<p>  <!-- Application styles -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://robdodson.me/assets/css/index.css">
</head></p>

<p><body>
  <!-- Main container -->
  <div role="main" id="main"></div></p>

<p>  <!-- Application source -->
  <script src="http://robdodson.me/assets/js/libs/require.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
I'm also going to define a file called foo.js which will just console log "Hello World!". To update our HTML we'll add the following script tag after the call to include require.js</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<script>
    require(["foo"]);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>And as expected the console outputs 'Hello World!'. Let's step it up a notch and define a module. Our first module will just return an object literal <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#defsimple">like in this example.</a> It will be a <code>Person</code> module with our name and city. We'll place it in an <code>app</code> folder in the root of our project. So our stucture looks like this:</p>

<p>```
index.html
|
|<em> app/
  |
  |</em> person.js
|
|<em> assets/
  |
  |</em> js/</p>

<pre><code>|
|_ libs/
  |
  |_ require.js
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>Person</code> module just needs to implement a define function which takes an object as an argument. It looks like this:
``` js app/person.js
define({</p>

<pre><code>name: "Rob Dodson",
city: "San Francisco"
</code></pre>

<p>});
```
And in our updated index.html we're going to require that module.</p>

<p>``` html
&lt;!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"></p>

<p>  <title>Require.js Sandbox</title></p>

<p>  <!-- Application styles -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://robdodson.me/assets/css/index.css">
</head></p>

<p><body>
  <!-- Main container -->
  <div role="main" id="main"></div></p>

<p>  <!-- Application source -->
  <script src="http://robdodson.me/assets/js/libs/require.js"></script>
  <script></p>

<pre><code>require(["app/person"], function(person) {
  console.log(person.name);
  console.log(person.city);
});
</code></pre>

<p>  </script>
</body>
</html>
```</p>

<p>Opening up that page in the browser should give us the proper output in the console.</p>

<h3>AMD modules for dummies</h3>

<p>Let's stop here for a moment to understand what's going on. In one file we implemented a <code>define</code> function and in another place we implemented a <code>require</code> function. In the most basic sense this is all we really need to do to start using AMD. I think the concept of javascript modules is really weird for most folks but if you're coming from a language like Java or Flash just think of define and require as two different interfaces that have to be implemented in order to recreate the <code>import</code> functionality that you're used to. Require.js is going to make sure everything loads properly so long as we stick to this convention.</p>

<p>If you're coming from more of a design background and you're used to having one big javascript file think of these modules as a way to break off pieces of code which you might otherwise put into separate script files. And I'm not talking one or two script files, I'm talking like 20 or 30. You could try to manage loading all of those dependencies yourself but that will be challenging. If you are building a blog then this probably isn't a big deal for you. In that case a few included js files is fine. But if you're trying to build a responsive web app for mobile then you're going to want to only load the bits of code you absolutely need. If a page doesn't require 90% of your JS then don't waste the time downloading it over a shitty AT&amp;T connection.</p>

<p>Ok let's write a module that's a bit more realistic. We'll use a function to return our object so it's kind of like a constructor.</p>

<p>``` js app/monster.js
"use strict";</p>

<p>define(function () {</p>

<pre><code>var estimated_age = 99 + 1;
var spookySaying = 'I vant to suck your blooood!';

return {
    name: 'Dracula',
    home: 'Florida',
    age: estimated_age,
    saySomethingSpooky: function() {
      console.log(spookySaying);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>``
This is a simple monster object. Notice that we build a variable called</code>estimated_age<code>right before defining our object literal. We then return this variable. If we ask for the monster's age it will return this value. It's worth noting that this makes the</code>estimated_age<code>variable private since it only lives in the scope of the anonymous function returning our object literal. We've also got a method,</code>saySomethingSpooky<code>which will print out another private variable</code>spookySaying`. Wow it's <em>almost</em> the JavaScript classes I've always dreamed of! Before you go thinking that remember that modules are not instanceable, meaning, when you load in a module it works like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton</a> almost. You can't go monster.new() all over the place.. it just doesn't work that way. Don't get disouraged though, this is still pretty cool so let's continue...</p>

<p>Next up is a module with dependencies. We'll make the monster depend on his coffin.</p>

<p>``` js app/coffin.js
"use strict";</p>

<p>define(function () {
  var color = 'Blackest black';</p>

<p>  return {</p>

<pre><code>color: color,
open: function() {
  console.log('*creeeeeek*');
}
</code></pre>

<p>  };
});
```</p>

<p>``` js app/monster.js
"use strict";</p>

<p>define(['./coffin'], function (coffin) {
  var estimated_age = 99 + 1;
  var spookySaying = 'I vant to suck your blooood!';</p>

<p>  return {</p>

<pre><code>name: 'Dracula',
home: 'Florida',
age: estimated_age,
saySomethingSpooky: function() {
  console.log(spookySaying);
},
goToSleep: function() {
  console.log('Time for bed!');
  coffin.open();
}
</code></pre>

<p>  };
});
```</p>

<p>``` html index.html</p>

<script data-main="" src="http://robdodson.me/assets/js/libs/require.js"></script>


<script>
  require(['app/monster'], function(monster) {
    monster.saySomethingSpooky();
    monster.goToSleep();
  });
</script>


<p><code>``
You can see that we've created a dependency for our monster, it has to load the coffin module before it's ready to be loaded itself. Otherwise it won't be able to run</code>goToSleep()<code>properly. Require.js will sort all of this out so long as we declare our dependencies as the first argument to the</code>define` function.</p>

<p>We aren't limited to objects though, we can also return functions (which are objects in their own right). For instance if we wanted to define a helper module that greets people we could do something like this:
``` js app/greet.js
"use strict";</p>

<p>define(function () {
  return function(name) {</p>

<pre><code>return 'Why hello, ' + name;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
<code>``
then in our index we'll just use the</code>greet` function as if it were globally available.</p>

<p><code>js index.html
require(['app/greet'], function(greet) {
  console.log(greet('Rob'));
});
</code>  <br/>
bear in mind that each module requires an http request to load it so you don't want to go overboard defining helper function modules. Note the extra http request in the profiler which loads greet.js.
<img class="center" src="/images/module_costs.png" title="'Note the separate http request for greet.js'" ></p>

<p>Ok that's it for today. I'll try to continue on Saturday!</p>

    <link href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/17/getting-familiar-with-backbone-boilerplate/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-17T07:47:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/17/getting-familiar-with-backbone-boilerplate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have an upcoming project which uses <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> so I thought it would be good to blog about the topics (particularly Backbone) for a while to make sure I'm well up to speed.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We're using the <a href="https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate">Backbone Boilerplate</a> to get us started since it includes a bit of file structure and a build process. As they mention in the docs you have to install <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">Grunt</a> if you want to use the build process they've stubbed out. Grunt is a javascript build tool which uses Node (think Rake in JS).</p>

<p>As a refresher course I'm going to dig into the open-source <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/">Backbone Fundamentals book</a> by <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/">Addy Osmani</a>.</p>

<p>First thing's first though, after we have nodejs and grunt installed we need to also install the bbb (backbone boilerplate build, I guess?) tool. You can <a href="https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb">grab it here.</a></p>

<p>We'll create a new folder for our project and run <code>bbb init</code>. If all goes well it should stub out some project directories and files for us.</p>

<h3>The Backbone Boilerplate templates</h3>

<p>I'll start with the index.html file. It seems like your standard HTML5 doc with the noteable exception that it includes <a href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>```html
&lt;!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"></p>

<p>  <title>Backbone Boilerplate</title></p>

<p>  <!-- Application styles -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://robdodson.me/assets/css/index.css">
</head></p>

<p><body>
  <!-- Main container -->
  <div role="main" id="main"></div></p>

<p>  <!-- Application source -->
  <script data-main="app/config" src="http://robdodson.me/assets/js/libs/require.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
Require.js is a module and file loader which will help us manage our AMD modules. AMD (which stands for Asynchronous Module Definition) is a specification which details how to break JS down into modules that are loaded in, as needed, at runtime. <a href="http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/">Again we turn to Addy Osmani for a good explanation.</a></p>

<p>If you notice this block:
```html</p>

<!-- Application source -->


<p>  <script data-main="app/config" src="http://robdodson.me/assets/js/libs/require.js"></script>
<code>``
the</code>data-main<code>attribute in the script tag is telling require.js what to load first. In this case it's the</code>app/config.js<code>file. If you omit the</code>js<code>require will add it for you. If you add the</code>.js` require will respect the path exactly as it was given. This distinction seems kind of trivial here but later on when you start configuring require with baseUrls and whatnot, it becomes more important.</p>

<p>Let's look at that confg file, shall we?</p>

<p>```javascript app/config.js
// Set the require.js configuration for your application.
require.config({
  // Initialize the application with the main application file
  deps: ["main"],</p>

<p>  paths: {</p>

<pre><code>// JavaScript folders
libs: "../assets/js/libs",
plugins: "../assets/js/plugins",

// Libraries
jquery: "../assets/js/libs/jquery",
underscore: "../assets/js/libs/underscore",
backbone: "../assets/js/libs/backbone",

// Shim Plugin
use: "../assets/js/plugins/use"
</code></pre>

<p>  },</p>

<p>  use: {</p>

<pre><code>backbone: {
  deps: ["use!underscore", "jquery"],
  attach: "Backbone"
},

underscore: {
  attach: "_"
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>One of the first things you can do with Require is to pass it a configuration object. The config object <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config">can be used for a ton of bootstrap options</a> like setting paths, requiring other scripts, setting timeouts, etc. The first option we see here is <code>deps: ["main"]</code>. We can infer this is telling require to load our main.js file first. But how does it get the path to main.js? From the docs we see that since we haven't defined a <code>baseUrl</code> property require is using the path from our <code>data-main</code> attribute.</p>

<blockquote><p>If no baseUrl is explicitly set in the configuration, the default value will be the location of the HTML page that loads require.js. If a data-main attribute is used, that path will become the baseUrl.</p></blockquote>

<p>So we know that our baseUrl is <code>app/</code> and anything we require will be relative to that.</p>

<p>Next up we have this block:</p>

<p>```js
paths: {</p>

<pre><code>// JavaScript folders
libs: "../assets/js/libs",
plugins: "../assets/js/plugins",

// Libraries
jquery: "../assets/js/libs/jquery",
underscore: "../assets/js/libs/underscore",
backbone: "../assets/js/libs/backbone",

// Shim Plugin
use: "../assets/js/plugins/use"
</code></pre>

<p>  },
```</p>

<p>The paths property defines paths relative to <code>baseUrl</code>. If we say
<code>js
require(["libs/module"])
</code>
require.js will look for this <code>libs</code> path and find it in our config file. Most of these make sense till we hit the last line which creates a path for the <code>use</code> plugin.</p>

<p><a href="http://tbranyen.com/post/amdrequirejs-shim-plugin-for-loading-incompatible-javascript">It seems like <code>use</code> was created by Tim Branyen, the author of the Backbone Boilerplate, to help with loading libraries that are non-AMD compliant.</a> Most of the big libraries are currently not AMD compliant (underscore and backbone itself) so this makes sense. So instead of creating a shim for each of those libraries the <code>use</code> plugin <em>should</em> take care of things for us. We can see how it's used further in the config file:</p>

<p>```js
use: {</p>

<pre><code>backbone: {
  deps: ["use!underscore", "jquery"],
  attach: "Backbone"
},

underscore: {
  attach: "_"
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>Let's start at the bottom so we can see that underscore is defined and mapped to "_". <code>attach</code> is going to take whatever library we're defining and attach it to <code>window</code>. So underscore will be attached as <code>window._</code>. Next we see that backbone is defined and depends on our version of underscore and jquery. Since jquery is AMD compliant we don't need the call to <code>use!</code> but we will need it for underscore. Finally backbone is attached to the window as <code>window.Backbone</code>.</p>

<p>That covers the configuration file. I'll move on to main.js in the next post.</p>
